## Windows or browser is saying it's a virus
Unfortunately windows is strict with what it wants to run.
The exe file isn't signed with a certificate, so Windows will say it's a virus regardless, unless you have dev certificates in your machine.

Best way around this is:
  Open Windows Security
  Go to Virus and Threat Protection
  Disable Real Time Protection
  You can reenable once you are done with running the program.
  Regardless if you forget it will re enable itself shortly, windows will force it on eventually.
